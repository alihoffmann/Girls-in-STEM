          <p class="col-sm-4 text-left"> Electrical engineers integrate any type of electrical components into various devices. They work in teams to design and manufacture electrical products from cellphones to cars. Many electrical engieners work closely with computers, and although there is a large overlap with electronics and computer engineers, many electrical engineers work with the supply and creation of power.  </p>

          <p> Let's break that down a bit further... </p>
          <p> If you look at any sort of device which requires power, an electrical engineer worked to design that item. Sometimes, it could be as small as the wireless mouse you are using with your computer. An electrical engineer works with other computer engineers and designers to determine how to convert the power from a battery into a functioning mouse. The computer engineers work on the technology to make the mouse work.

          Before anything gets too confusing, it is important that you undersstand how electrical and computer engineering overlap. In fact electrical and computer engineering overlap so much that multiple colleges will allow you to major in ECE or electrical and computer engineering. This is an integrated degree where students learn about electrical and computer engineering. It is combined because these disciplines have a large amount of overlap. Electrical engineers work with computers and need to udnerstand how the computers work. Similarly, computer engineers need to understand the conversion of power and how to create it in order to create functioning products. It is likely that either way you will encounter the other type of engineering because of the nature of the subject.
